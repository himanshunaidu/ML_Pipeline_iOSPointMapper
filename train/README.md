# Train

This directory contains helper functions for the training of the models in the CoreML_Pipeline_iOSPointMapper pipeline.
This directory is not intended to be used for training the models directly, but rather to provide a reference for how to train the models in the original repositories.
It is recommended to perform the training in the original repositories, and then bring the model to this repository for conversion and inference.
