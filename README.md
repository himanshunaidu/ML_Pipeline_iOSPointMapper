# CoreML Pipeline iOSPointMapper

This is a Machine Learning pipeline for the iOSPointMapper application that deals with training (predominantly vision) models and converting them to CoreML format. 
This project takes heavy inspiration from [EdgeNets](https://github.com/sacmehta/EdgeNets.git), but several modifications are made to work with newer library versions.
